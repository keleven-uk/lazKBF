Kill those bothersome files with KBF.

Kill Bothersome Files - kills those bothersome files, that get in the way.

[also, finds and kills empty directories - if they bother you.]

Originally written to remove Thumbs.db files from photograph directories.


Choose the root directory and the type of bothersome files.
The root directory will then be walked - when the kill button becomes available, kill those little suckers!!!

Direction for use ...

1 ... Select the root directory.
2 ... Select what to kill.
3 ... Wait while the directory is walked - can take some time - sorry.
4 ... Select which files to kill [either All, None or individually].
5 ... Kill those bothersome files [see warning below].

The clear button allows a rescan of the chosen directory; say if the choice of files have been altered.

Double clicking on any file [or empty directory] will give further file details.


The LED will show a flashing GREEN while searching, but steady RED when not.

WARNING

.::. This program permanently deletes files - does not use the recycle bin [I don't know that bit yet]. .::.

erm,  It does now delete to the recycle bin - thanks to http://forum.lazarus-ide.org/index.php?topic=12288.0.
