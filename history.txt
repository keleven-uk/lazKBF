There was a slight bug with empty directories.  To make them stand out
in the listbox, I appended them with Empty DIR.  This made it fail when
trying to find the directory again and delete it.  Added a function to
remove this sub string from the beginning of directory entries.  This
function is then called by the delete and pop-op info procedures.
    
Also, amended the delete procedure to delete to recycle bin if desired.
This can be chosen from a check box on the front screen.
    
Also, added a checkbox to show the progress screen for deletions.
    
Also, added a LED control which flashed green while searching.
    
Also, cleaned up code in frmmain.pas.
    
Amended uinfo.pas to hold version, application name and me in variables.
    
Amended the Help, About & Licence form to use these variables.

Renamed all form files from uxxx.pas to formxxx.pas.
i.e.  uKlock.pas -> formKlock.pas.
    
So, all source files that contain GUI elements will start with form.
All none GUI source files will start with u - a unit file.

Added uInfo.pas, which contains the following constants
        strName = my name plus copyright info.
        strAppName = programme name.
        strEmail = my email address.
        strVersion = programme version.
    
These are used in the info screens and main programme.
